Rose is a tired museum janitor with a dream:  
**Sun, sea, and absolutely no night shifts.**  

But with a paycheck that barely covers lunch, the Caribbean feels a million miles away —  
unless she *borrows* a few precious artifacts along the way...

## About the Game

**Gallery Grabber** is a 2D top-down stealth game where you must juggle your janitorial duties with your totally-not-legal heist plan.

- Clean the museum floors and avoid suspicion  
- Steal priceless exhibits using your cleaning machine  
- Outsmart guards and security cameras  
- Don’t get fired — or caught!

**Clean smart. Steal smarter.**  
And maybe — just maybe — you’ll trade dusty marble halls for sandy Caribbean beaches.
